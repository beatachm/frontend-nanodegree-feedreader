## Project Goal
This project is a task assigned to me in the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree program. The goal of it was to write automated tests to a provided Feed Reader app. 

## Dependencies
* [jQuery v2.1.1](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
* [Jasmine v2.1.2](https://jasmine.github.io) - Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.
* [handlebars v2.0.0](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Handlebars provides the power necessary to let you build semantic templates effectively with no frustration. Handlebars is largely compatible with Mustache templates. In most cases it is possible to swap out Mustache with Handlebars and continue using your current templates.
